\section{
\textbf{Introduction}}
\subsection*{Background of the study}
\paragraph{Data Entry}
; Many significant technological changes have occurred in the IT industry since the beginning of the 21st century. Data entry was by means of hardcopy, big data and it was always fed into the books, ledgers. There has been an outstanding advance in technology with powerful tools like the OdK collect and package, Google cloud computing and platforms and many others.

\paragraph{Closer Look}
Data entry tasks tend to be low on the totem pole in terms of business operational priorities. However, data entry is still one of the most critical day-to-day operations for companies across the industry. Everything from customer and sales data to financial information relies heavily on data entry, meaning a single error can have huge ramifications for your company.
 Even with advancement in technology, there are still some glitches in data entry which we seek to curb hence this proposal.

\section{
\textbf{Statement of the problem}}
\paragraph*{}
The problem being solved or implemented is users entering inaccurate data which sometimes results into data inconsistency, data invalidation among others.

\section{
\textbf{Objectives}}
\paragraph*{}
-	To curb data inconsistency where same data is stored in different formats lets say duplication of files.
-	To help in data validation ensuring data cleansing and improve data quality.
-	To help users enter accurate data easily and learn to always have a good data entry system.

\section{
\textbf{General objective}}
\paragraph*{}
To help users learn and master any difficulties that entails data entry inorder to always aim at providing accurate data.

\section{
\textbf{Specific objective}}
\paragraph*{}
To help in accuracy in data entry and help users easily enter data
\\
-to help in ease and convenience during data entry..
-To help in data consistency and data validation especially when entering data.
-To generally help all sorts of data users, literate, illiterate and semi- illiterate users who all enter data.

\section{
\textbf{Scope}}
This research is going to contain samples of inaccurate data, how the solution is going to be implemented.. Examples of data inconsistency and also samples of how data can be validated and stored properly so as to avoid "unclean" or wrong data. Sources of big data and how it was done before the 21st century. Examples of the technological advancements of data entry. The research is going to entail all kids of users and the problems they face as they do data entry, such as the very literate, semi-literate and the illiterate.
  
\section{
\textbf{Significance of the study}}
\paragraph*{}
\begin{center}
\textit{"No matter how much users may double-check their work, mistakes always slip through the cracks"}
\end{center}
\\
This study or research should help all kinds of users who do data entry to be better when entering data and to conquer all the difficulties that come with data entry. There is need to provide all the examples that deal with data entry and big data  before and after the 21st century. The technological advancements that have come with dealing with data entry , the new ways of data entry that are convenient and their glitches and the solutions that can be implemented.
